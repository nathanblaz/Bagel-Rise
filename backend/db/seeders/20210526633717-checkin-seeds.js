Had high hopes for this place considering its proximity to my home but Beautyâ€™s still holds the neighborhood crown. Most likely will not come back and would not recommend.",

Everyone working had dark hair except one employee. She seemed flustered when she kept asking people what was on their order and asked me what other sandwich I had aside from what I ordered (only had one sandwich). Start with keeping all your hair pulled back, including the little side bits, and breath. Iâ€™ve never had any issue here so thatâ€™s why itâ€™s 3 stars.",
